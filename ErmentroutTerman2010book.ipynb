For a Riemann integral, any $t_j<\\tau_j<t_{j-1}$ will do. But for stochastic integration, the choice of $\\tau_j$ matters. Ito integral: $\\tau_j=t_{j-1}$. Stratonovich integral: $\\tau_j=(t_j+t_{j-1})/2$. In neural modeling, people prefer Stratonovich if noise has correlations and we take limit as correlation time goes to zero. If $B$ is constant in equation (10.1), then both are equivalent."
